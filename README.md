GIST 604B: Creating a Repo Assignment by Michael Macias
## About Me:
Hello, my name is **Michael Macias** and I am currently a student in the university of arizona's MSGIST Program. I discovered GIS while
pursuing my undergraduate studies in biological science and was impressed by all of its capabilities. I have learned so much while in
the program and hope one day to put this newly gained knowledge to good use in natural resource management. I have never used Github before
so I'm excited to learn it as well as other opensource software tied to GIS. Personally, I love being outdoors, especially going hiking, 
but I also enjoy playing guitar and piano during my freetime.
